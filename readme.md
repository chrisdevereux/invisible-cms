# invisible-cms

an experimental cms system that uses the user-facing UI as its own admin interface

currently in prototype state

## quickstart

* grab a starter project that uses firebase to host the cms backend, netlify to host the site and gatsby as a build tool:

```bash
svn export https://github.com/chrisdevereux/invisible-cms/trunk/examples/example-firebase-netlify-gatsby invisible-cms-example-firebase-netlify-gatsby
cd invisible-cms-example-firebase-netlify-gatsby
git init
yarn
```

* follow the steps in readme.md to setup the project
